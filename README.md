# Pokemon_Ultra_demake
Personal project with the knowledge acquired in the first term of the College.
Hello guys!
Knowing that the best way to learn is by doing, 
I decided to recreate part of a game that followed many childhoods and thus practice some concepts learned in this first term of College.

So far we have the following:

*Home menu with a series of If statements and loop.
*Round trip structure to new areas.

---------------------------

To be implemented:

*Starting Pokemon pick system.

*Pokemon hunting system (With random encounters).

*Pokemon capture system (They will be the game's collectibles).

*Battle system against Gym Leader in Pewter.
